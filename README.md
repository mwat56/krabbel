When writing web applications (server and/or client) debugging, refactoring and testing brings you only so far.
One of the things that are not easy to mock or fake is a certain workload that shows you how your application is behaving under load.
This is were `krabbel` comes in: it's basically just a web-crawler that tries to get all local links within an URL as soon as possible.
Its sole purpose is to produce some kind of stress test that shows how well your web-server reacts under load.
